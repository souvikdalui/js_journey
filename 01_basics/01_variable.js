// syntax of variable

const accountId = 12345; // "const" - once declared, we can't change its value.
let accountEmail = "souvik@gmail.com"; // "let" - we can change its value whenever we need.
var accountPassword = "234521" // old syntax, there are issues with scoping, which is not a good practice.

let accountState ;


console.log(accountId);

// 

console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity, accountState]);
